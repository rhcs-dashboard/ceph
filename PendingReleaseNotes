>=14.2.2
--------

* Nautilus-based librbd clients can now open images on Jewel clusters.

* The RGW "num_rados_handles" has been removed.
  If you were using a value of "num_rados_handles" greater than 1
  multiply your current "objecter_inflight_ops" and
  "objecter_inflight_op_bytes" paramaeters by the old
  "num_rados_handles" to get the same throttle behavior.

14.2.2
------

* The no{up,down,in,out} related commands has been revamped.
  There are now 2 ways to set the no{up,down,in,out} flags:
  the old 'ceph osd [un]set <flag>' command, which sets cluster-wide flags;
  and the new 'ceph osd [un]set-group <flags> <who>' command,
  which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node,
  or device class.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.
